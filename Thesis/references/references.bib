abstract = {Mobile devices supporting the “Internet of Things” often have limited capabilities in computation, battery energy, and storage space, especially to support resource-intensive applications involving virtual reality, augmented reality, multimedia delivery, and artificial intelligence, which could require broad bandwidth, low response latency, and large computational power. Edge cloud or edge computing is an emerging topic and a technology that can tackle the deficiencies of the currently centralized-only cloud computing model and move the computation and storage resources closer to the devices in support of the above-mentioned applications. To make this happen, efficient coordination mechanisms and “offloading” algorithms are needed to allow mobile devices and the edge cloud to work together smoothly. In this survey article, we investigate the key issues, methods, and various state-of-the-art efforts related to the offloading problem. We adopt a new characterizing model to study the whole process of offloading from mobile devices to the edge cloud. Through comprehensive discussions, we aim to draw an overall “big picture” on the existing efforts and research directions. Our study also indicates that the offloading algorithms in the edge cloud have demonstrated profound potentials for future technology and application development.},

abstract={Fast growth of produced data from deferent smart devices such as smart mobiles, IoT/IIoT networks, and vehicular networks running different specific applications such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and positioning systems, demand more and more processing and storage resources. Offloading is a promising technique to cope with the inherent limitations of such devices by which the resource-intensive code or at least a part of it will be transferred to the nearby resource-rich servers. Different approaches have been proposed to help make better decisions in respect of whether, where, when, and how much to offload and to improve the efficiency of the offloading process in the literature. On the other hand, the dynamic behavior of mobile devices running on-demand applications faces the offloading to the new challenges, which could be described as stochastic behaviors. Therefore, various stochastic offloading models have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, despite the existence of plenty of related offloading studies in the literature, there is not any systematic, comprehensive, and detailed survey paper focusing on stochastic-based offloading mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a survey paper concerning the stochastic-based offloading approaches in various computation environments such as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), and Fog Computing (FC) in which to identify new mechanisms, a classical taxonomy is presented. The proposed taxonomy is classified into three main fields: Markov chain, Markov process, and Hidden Markov Models. Then, open issues and future unexplored or inadequately explored research challenges are discussed, and the survey is finally concluded.},

abstract = {This paper presents MAUI, a system that enables fine-grained energy-aware offload of mobile code to the infrastructure. Previous approaches to these problems either relied heavily on programmer support to partition an application, or they were coarse-grained requiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses the benefits of a managed code environment to offer the best of both worlds: it supports fine-grained code offload to maximize energy savings with minimal burden on the programmer. MAUI decides at run-time which methods should be remotely executed, driven by an optimization engine that achieves the best energy savings possible under the mobile device's current connectivity constrains. In our evaluation, we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive face recognition application that consumes an order of magnitude less energy, 2) a latency-sensitive arcade game application that doubles its refresh rate, and 3) a voice-based language translation application that bypasses the limitations of the smartphone environment by executing unsupported components remotely.},

abstract={Cloud offloading is considered a promising approach for both energy conservation and storage/computation enhancement for resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we present a Lyapunov optimization-based scheme for cloud offloading scheduling, as well as download scheduling for cloud execution output, for multiple applications running in a mobile device with a multi-core CPU. We derive an online algorithm and prove performance bounds for the proposed algorithm with respect to average power consumption and average queue length, which is indicative of delay, and reveal the fundamental tradeoff between the two optimization goals. The performance of the proposed online scheduling scheme is validated with trace-driven simulations.},
